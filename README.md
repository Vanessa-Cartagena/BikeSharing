# NYC CitiBike Sharing Anaylsis
In this module, we used Tableau, a data visualization program, to create a business proposal for a bike-sharing service. We learned the skills necessary to accurately import, style, and represent data. Then, worksheets, dashboards, and stories were made to visually represent important data from a dataset for New York CitiBike.

Showed the number of bike trips made on each day of the week by each category of user and gender. Among all riders, male riders are the busiest.

We propose two more visualizations for further analysis such as analyzing data from various months to identify yearly trends and if you want to determine whether the weather has an impact on your rides, incorporate weather data.
